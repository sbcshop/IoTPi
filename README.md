## IoTPi is an industrial board that consists of onboard RP2040, ESP8266 WIFI(ESP-12E) and RS-485 communication that can control up to 4/6 appliances/devices on a load    of, photo-coupling isolation Optocoupler EL357NC, allowing users to safely control high voltages or current devices. IoTPi makes appliances smart, which users can operate via the PiRelay app on their electronic device. IoTPi is also consist of addition GPIOs pins for connecting extra Hardware to this board.

## RS-485
### RS-485 is an industrial specification that defines the electrical interface and physical layer for point-to-point communication of electrical devices. The RS-485 standard allows for long cabling distances in electrically noisy environments and can support multiple devices on the same bus. It is a serial communication protocols and are ubiquitous device interfaces.
